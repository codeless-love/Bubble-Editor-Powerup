Bulk Branch Delete makes it easy to remove multiple branches at once from your Bubble app, directly from the Powerup extension popup.

## How It Works

- Open your Bubble editor.
- Click the Powerup extension icon in your browser.
- In the popup, scroll down to the "Bulk Branch Delete" option from the menu.
- Choose the branches you want to delete.
- Confirm your selection to quickly remove all selected branches.

This feature streamlines branch management, saving you time and effort when cleaning up old or unused branches.
